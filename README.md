Walmart is the retail corporation and has a chain of hypermarkets. The data provided is 2,5 years weekly sales data from 45 stores and 81 department. This repository contains an end-to-end analysis and forecasting project using the Walmart Sales Forecast dataset from Kaggle. The goal of this project is to explore historical sales data, understand trends, important features and  uild machine learning models to forecast future sales.
To do that I will use Gradient Boosting model and Exponential Smoothing model.
